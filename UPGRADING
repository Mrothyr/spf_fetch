The output from `spf_update_pf` is now directed to
`common_domains_ips` rather than the previous `common_domains_white`.

If you're using a `pf(5)` table you'll want to rewrite line in
`pf.conf(5)` to something like:

--------
table <common_white> persist file "/etc/mail/common_domains_ips"
--------
